## Tree-Va Time

Tree-Va Time was inspired by the infamous typo at a local Vermont bar that was advertising its weekly "Triva Nights".
This CLI app is a simple one, allowing users to create an account, select questions from a variety of categories, get hints, and ultimately determine just how prepared they might be for the next live taping of Jeopardy!.

 - Back in your terminal, type "bundle install".
 - Then, from the root directory, run "rake db:migrate" to create the database locally.
 - Lastly, run "rake db:seed". Now you're ready to go!

Good luck!

## Playing the Game: Commands

At various points during the game, menus will pop up offering several options. You will either need to use your arrow keys to move up and down; hit ENTER to select an option. Or, you can type the number corresponding to your desired option.

In some cases, you may be asked to type yes/no. Hitting ENTER will be treated as a 'yes'.
